# Advent of Code 2024 - Bash

Doing this year advent of code in bash for the challenge and to consolidate my bash skill.
I will try to keep core utils to a minimum and only use bash builtin functionality.
So no `awk`, no `grep`, no `sed`.

## How to run the scripts

For each day, the will be a `part1.bash` and `part2.bash` since each problem is divided into two parts.  
Also there is a `sample.txt` which is the example from the website and `input.txt` which is the real challenge
Each script expects the input to be given from stdin, so to run a script, do:

```sh
$ bash part1.bash <input.txt
```

If the command to run the script changes for a day, there will be a specific README in the directory for that day
