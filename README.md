# Advent of Code 2024 - Bash

Doing this year advent of code in bash for the challenge and to consolidate my bash skill.
I will try to keep core utils to a minimum and only use bash builtin functionality.
So no `awk`, no `grep`, no `sed`.

For day 1, the only external tools I used where 
- `mkfifo`
- `sort`
- `rm`

I writing a `sort` function in bash is easily doable, and for `mkfifo` and `rm` I have an alternate solution.
So none of them are mandatory. I might modify the solution to day 1 later on.
