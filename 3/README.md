# Day 3

Nothing special, some string processing using regexes to find the 'mul(x,y)', using capture groups for the numbers

For part 2, the easiest way, at least to reuse the code from part 1, was to do two pass over the input.
First part is to remove all the 'mul(x,y)' which are deactivated and the store the rest in a string,
than with final string, it's the same as part 1
